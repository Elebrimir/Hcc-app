# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only modifies DOCS files, only @docs-owner will be requested for a review.
